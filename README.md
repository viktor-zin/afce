AFCE
====

AFCE is a algorithm аlowchart editor with code generation and vector graphics. It has a simple graphical user interface written on Qt. This software is cross-platform and can be built under Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS (I didn't test).

AFCE allows to create, edit, print and export flowcharts easily for a few minutes. Flowcharts can be exported to several graphical formats including SVG and PNG.

Also AFCE can generate a source code based on the flowchart.
